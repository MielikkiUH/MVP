# MVP

To install requirements


```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To install all packages in this repo globally (run from root of repo):


```
pip install -e .
```


To run web application

```
python MVP/app.py
```

Then go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 on the browser.

Add the models in the MVU/models directory and I will be able to integrate them without much trouble when I wake up.
The models package (folder) is already imported into the web application so adding the files there will make the
integration super easy.

Things todo in this web application could be some interactive map that only is displayed when the user uploads the data
and also better design for the front end. But I need more details about what is wanted to do this.
